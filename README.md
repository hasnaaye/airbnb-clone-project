# airbnb-clone-project
<h3>Project Description</h3>
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.
<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)<br>
Version Control: Git and GitHub<br>
Design Tools: Figma for UI/UX design<br>
<h3>UI/UX Design Planning</h3>
<table>
<tr>
  <th>Property Listing View	:</th> <th>Grid display of available properties with filters</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Listing Detailed View	:</th> <th>Complete property details with images and booking form</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Simple Checkout View	:</th> <th>Streamlined payment and booking confirmation</th>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Importance of User-Friendly Design:</h3>
A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.
